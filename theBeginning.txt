Now before we begin the story, I want to introduce you to this story's hero before he came into his strength and fame. This is when Reek was 12 years old.
Sadly Reek was not gifted with the best of looks at a young age, and when I say this, I don't mean to say only had a crooked nose, or a limp. This poor lad had nothing going for him physical wise. He walked with a limp, squint small mouth, such a small chin it was almost non existent, dry flaky skin. Onl;y thing he had going for him was his smarts and his icy silver eyes.
